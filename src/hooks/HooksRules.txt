Rules of Hooks
There are two rules for using hooks:

1. Only call hooks at the top level of a function component. Don’t call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
2. Only call hooks from React function components. Don’t call hooks from regular JavaScript functions (unless you are creating a custom hook — more on this soon!) or class components.
